This is a minimalistic yet complete web-app for a TODO list meant for learning purposes, to demonstrate the basics of web development. 

# Prerequisites 

You should have preliminary understanding of web development ("what is HTML", "what is a variable"). You should have Ruby and Mongo installed. 

# Run the app
You run the app via 

````$ shotgun app.rb````

Play around with it - there's not much to do. Add a task with a name & description, remove the task, hey presto. 

# Learn by changing 
1. Change the app header to include your name ("Welcome to Joe's TODO Manager").
