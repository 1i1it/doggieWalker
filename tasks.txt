Tasks
1. Make 'mark as complete' as the task_id S
2. Add  'mark incomplete' 
3. Always show only either 'mark as complete' or 'mark incomplete' (as appropriate)
4. Create GitHub account, push code to GitHub repo.
4.1. Make some changes, make a commit, push those changes to GitHub.
5. Dropdown of owners - instead of hard-coding the values, make them read from a Ruby variable (owners = ['Sella', ...])
6. Move the Ruby variable defining the list of owners to a new file (app_config.rb). Remember to 'require' that file in the app.
7. Create a "user" page: add a "get /:user" route that will render a "user.erb" file. In that file, first just show the user's name, then use "$tasks.find({name: params[:username]}).to_a" to get the tasks that belong to that user, then use "erb :tasks_list" to show just HIS tasks. 
8. In 'add task' form, add another text field for a URL of an image (for a tasks) and store that url with each task, and display it in the list of tasks.
9. When displaying the number of tasks (Tasks (1)), change it to also display how many Tasks have been completed. "(Tasks (total 2, completed: 1))". You can do this by running "$tasks.find(criteria).count" where criteria a hash specifying 'completed' to be true.
10. Sign Up: create a 'sign_up' page where one can create a user (similarly to creating a task).
11. Populate the dropdown of 'owners' from the list of existing users.
